# g5-restore

Checking for serials. 

You can find them under the main cover. I had bought 3 from FB marketplace (for 150$): 

Cl62901ev5w dual 2.3 512 250 6600 
G853758gru2 2.0 51 160 9600

So based on this we can already tell which one is useless and which one is good :)

Luckily from the 3 I bought 2 of them were the later 2.3 Ghz releases which use regular PCIe (versus AGP connectors) which means we can upgrade most pieces.

## Checking power cables & water damage

So this is a C19-C20 cable for the later 2005 g5's.The cases of theses are super heavy and cool looking!

While earlier versions use the common C13-C14 cables you find on many devices still to this day. 

The power supply on these is seated at the bottom and takes the full width of the base of the computer, it's a pretty crazy set-up but they can be found second hand or refurbished.
It is also quite ez to retrofubrish a more modern PSU into the case. 

Better to check the cables for damage (often  present when they were plugged-in/out many times) and get new cables. I decided to get new ones cause mine looked like hell. 

## RAM
---

The original ram sticks are horrible for modern comparison, so we can upgrade safely with backwards compatibility to:

240 Pin Dimm - 1.8v - PC2-4200 (533Mhz) - ECC Registered x4 2GiB

Bringing our ram from 512 mb (2x 256mb) to 8Gib. Which is considerable upgrade!

## Memory
---
We can use regular SATA SSDs which are backward compatible even tho we will not get the full speed, you can get them for cheap reconditionned (20$ for 512 GiB)

## GPU
---
You can also go wild and upgrade GPU using regular PCIe connectors, you can also get modifications boards with the remaining PCIe slots!
